# Car Builder

Car Builder is a 3D sandbox game that is designed for anyone to build the car of their dreams. You can select over 20 different textures for the blocks and move and jump around in a Minecraft-like environment. The world will autosave and you can reset the world if you want to set the world to an empty field.

## Controls

* **Movement**: W, A, S, D
* **Jump**: Space
* **Select Texture**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, R, T, Y, U, I, O, P, H, J, K, L
* **Place Block**: Left Click
* **Delete Block**: Alt + Left Click

You can click directly on the ground to place a block, in the air or you can click any face of an existing block to add a block on that particular side. When deleting a block, the block that is the closest to the middle cursor will be deleted.

**Note**: The camera will lock the cursor when you click into the window, so you may have to press Esc a couple times to navigate the menu to reset the world.

## Texture Selector

Pressing any of the respective _Select Texture_ keys will bring up the texture menu when choosing a new texture.

The block options from left to right are: paints, glass, and wheels. The glass is made to be more transparent than the rest of the blocks, and one of the wheel textures has a similar effect to mimic spokes of a real wheel. The plane is 100x100, so there is plenty of space to place blocks and make many different kinds of vehicles.
